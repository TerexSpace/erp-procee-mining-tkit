# ERP-ProcessMiner Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for `ERP-ProcessMiner`, a Python toolkit for process mining on ERP event logs.

This toolkit is designed to help researchers, teachers, and analysts bridge the gap between raw, relational ERP data and the structured event logs required for process mining.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project, the best place to start is the `README.md` file in the root of the repository. It provides a quick overview of the project, installation instructions, and a simple example.

## Tutorials

The following tutorials provide a more in-depth guide to using the toolkit for common process mining tasks:

- **[Tutorial 1: From ERP Data to an Event Log (Procure-to-Pay)] (tutorials/p2p_from_erp_logs.ipynb)**: This tutorial walks through the process of loading relational ERP data for a procure-to-pay process, transforming it into an event log, and discovering a process model.

- **[Tutorial 2: Conformance Checking (Order-to-Cash)](tutorials/o2c_conformance.ipynb)**: This tutorial demonstrates how to perform conformance checking to compare a process model with an event log for an order-to-cash process.
