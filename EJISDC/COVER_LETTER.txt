Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "ERP-ProcessMiner: An Accessible Open-Source Toolkit for Process Mining in Resource-Constrained Educational and Organizational Contexts" for consideration in the Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries (EJISDC).

Process mining offers significant potential for improving organizational efficiency and decision-making. However, adoption in developing countries faces substantial barriers including prohibitive licensing costs, steep learning curves, limited computational resources, and documentation gaps. Our paper directly addresses these challenges by presenting an open-source toolkit specifically designed for accessibility in resource-constrained contexts.

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:

1. Declarative Configuration Approach: Reduces preprocessing code complexity by 57.1% compared to traditional scripting approaches, lowering barriers for practitioners with limited programming expertise.

2. Resource Efficiency: Demonstrates 35% lower memory usage compared to established tools, enabling deployment on modest hardware typical of educational institutions in developing economies.

3. Educational Accessibility: Validation-first design with clear error messages supports self-directed learning and reduces dependence on scarce expert instructors.

4. Open Licensing: MIT license eliminates cost barriers entirely, making process mining accessible to educational institutions and small enterprises.

Our experimental evaluation on synthetic procure-to-pay datasets provides statistically validated results (n=10 iterations, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) demonstrating the toolkit's effectiveness for rapid prototyping, classroom instruction, and first-time process mining implementations.

ALIGNMENT WITH EJISDC SCOPE:

This work directly aligns with EJISDC's mission to publish research relevant to information systems in developing country contexts. We specifically address:

- ICT adoption barriers in resource-constrained environments
- Educational technology accessibility in developing economies  
- Practical tools for organizations with limited technical infrastructure
- Open-source solutions for bridging the digital divide

The paper emphasizes practical applicability over theoretical sophistication, prioritizing accessibility and real-world impact in contexts where commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive or technically infeasible.

ORIGINALITY AND ETHICS:

We confirm that:
- This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal
- All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to EJISDC
- The research adheres to ethical standards for software research
- All cited works are properly attributed
- We have no conflicts of interest to declare
