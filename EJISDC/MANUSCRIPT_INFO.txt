ABSTRACT
--------
Process mining offers significant potential for improving organizational efficiency by extracting actionable insights from operational data. However, adoption in developing countries faces barriers including software complexity, licensing costs, and steep learning curves. This paper presents ERP-ProcessMiner, an open-source Python toolkit designed specifically for accessibility in resource-constrained contexts. The toolkit addresses the critical preprocessing stage of transforming Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data into event logs through a declarative JSON-based configuration system with validation-first semantics. We evaluate ERP-ProcessMiner against the established pm4py library across four dimensions: (1) code complexity reduction, (2) discovery quality, (3) computational resource efficiency, and (4) educational accessibility. Results from experiments on synthetic procure-to-pay datasets demonstrate that ERP-ProcessMiner reduces preprocessing code by 57.1%, requires 35% less memory, and provides superior error handling for novice users. While pm4py achieves higher fitness scores (1.00 vs 0.76), ERP-ProcessMiner's design trade-offs favor rapid prototyping, classroom instruction, and first-time process mining implementations in organizations with limited technical expertise. The toolkit is freely available under the MIT license, eliminating licensing barriers for educational institutions and small enterprises in developing economies.
