abstract: |
  ERP-ProcessMiner is a Python toolkit that transforms relational ERP exports into
  canonical event logs and applies core process mining techniques for discovery,
  conformance, and performance analysis. The package offers an end-to-end workflow
  from declarative mapping of ERP tables through log construction to model discovery,
  evaluation, and visualization.
